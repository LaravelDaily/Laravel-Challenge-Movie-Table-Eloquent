# Laravel Challenge: Movie Table - Eloquent Performance

This is a visual table of TOP 100 movies ordered by average rating. The performance of that table needs to be improved, in whatever way possible, so the table and the full page would load much quicker.

Your task is to improve the code, by submitting a Pull Request.

---

## Rules: How to perform the task

I will be expecting a Pull Request to the `main` branch, containing **all** fixes with completely working project.

If you don't know how to contribute a PR, here's [my video with instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEcT6JIFji0).

**Important**: I will NOT merge the Pull Request, only comment on it, whether it's correct or not.

With my limited time, I will probably personally review first 10 Pull Requests, all the others will still get "karma points" by doing a good job to help the author.

If you have any questions, or suggestions for the future challenges, please open an Issue.

Good luck!
